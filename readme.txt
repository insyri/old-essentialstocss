Story Time.

This was created in early 2020, when I had a project about html and css, we were supposed to use Google Sites and embed a custom html block into it for a grade; criteria based on looks and information. I wanted to work inside VSCode, so I did it here. If I can remember correctly, I spent a whole week on this, from noon to night, and unfortunately, it didn't scale nicely in the html block, so I wrote the whole thing as a seperate thing. 

Ironically, when I told my technology teacher the situtation and how they could view it properly, they didn't unzip it.
So, the html, css, and images couldn't link together.

I got a bad grade.

Meh, I don't know what to say, I remember I joked about this forever and I seldomly bring this up to others when I do remember it. I was mad when it first happened but later it just became a funny story to tell.

As you can see just from taking a glance at the source... I wasn't very knowledgeable at all.
I don't know why I uploaded this. Happy reading, and spend your time on something more valuable.
